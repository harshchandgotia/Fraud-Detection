# Fraud-Detection

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions from a highly imbalanced dataset. The objective is to maximize fraud detection accuracy while minimizing false positives using supervised models and class balancing techniques.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights
- Used Kaggleâ€™s anonymized credit card dataset (284,807 transactions, 0.172% fraud).
- Performed data preprocessing (scaling, outlier removal, feature engineering).
- Trained and evaluated models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM.
- Achieved best F1-score of **0.944** and recall of **0.894** using Logistic Regression on balanced data.
- Applied SMOTE with cross-validation; Random Forest reached **0.9005** F1-score consistently.
